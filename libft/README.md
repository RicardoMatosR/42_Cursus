# Description

Libft is the first foundational project of the 42 curriculum.

The main objective is to reimplement from scratch a selection of functions from the standard C library (`libc`), while also developing additional utility functions that are not part of the standard library but prove extremely useful in future projects.

Through this project, several fundamental programming concepts are explored in depth:

* Manual memory management
* Pointer manipulation
* String handling
* Memory block operations
* Type conversion
* Dynamic data structures through linked lists

This library becomes a reusable tool that serves as the foundation for many subsequent projects in the 42 curriculum.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

In compliance with the project requirements:

Artificial Intelligence was used exclusively as a supporting tool for:

* Understanding the behavior of certain standard library functions.
* Clarifying concepts related to memory management, pointers, and linked lists.
* Analyzing edge cases.
* Reviewing documentation and improving the quality of this README.

The implementation, debugging, and final validation of all functions were performed manually by the author.
